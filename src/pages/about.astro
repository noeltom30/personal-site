  <h1><span class="highlight">Hello there!</span></h1>
  <h2><span class="underline">I'm Noel Tom</span></h2>
  <p>
    A Computer Science Engineering sophomore at Amrita Bangalore. I occasionaly indulge in competetive programming and also sometimes play CTFs. 
  </p>
  <p>
    As of late, Productivity apps and concepts have piqued my interest so I will eventually begin working on some sort of a project in that space. Why live, if not to pomodoro your way through any given crisis. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I have too many interests and hobbies wrestling for my time, so I choose to be a diplomat and pursue none of them.  
    Although, I do really, really like keyboards and basketball. I'm a huge Warriors fan and would like to bring to your notice that Steph Curry is the Greatest Shooter of All Time. 
    <!-- I love learning new languages and skills that have close to zero value in real life, e.g, cardistry, writing with my non dominant hand etc.  -->
  </p>
  <p>
    I have very strong opinions on music, computer mice, rice and water.
