  <h1>Hello there!</h1>
  <h2>I'm Noel Tom</h2>
  <p>
    A Computer Science Engineering sophomore at Amrita Bangalore. I have turned to the internet for real estate. I'm still kinda new to programming. I occasionaly indulge in competetive programming and also sometimes play CTFs. 
  </p>
  <p>
    As of late, Productivity apps and concepts have piqued my interest so I will <strong>eventually</strong> begin working on some sort of a project along those lines. The goal is to pomodoro my way through my through any apparent crisis. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I have too many interests and hobbies wrestling for my time, so I choose to be a diplomat and pursue none of them. 
    Although, I do really, really like keyboards and basketball. I'm a huge Warriors fan and would like to bring to your notice that Steph Curry is the Greatest Shooter of All Time.    
  </p>
  <p>
    I have very strong opinions on music, computer mice, rice and water.
